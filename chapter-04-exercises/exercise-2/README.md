# Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.

| _Course Name_ | **Course Number** | Instructor Name   |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------    |
| _INFO_        | **201**           | Kyle Thayer       |
| _ART_         | **140**           | Bogosi Sekhukhuni |
| _ENGL_        | **200**           | Krista L. Daniel  |
